# Introduction

This little book introduces the practices of TDD (Test-Driven Development) and shows you how to use them in the development of Go applications using practical examples. It demonstrates how to leverage the benefits of TDD in applications at every level, ensuring that **they deliver functional and non-functional requirements**. It also touches on important principles of how to design and implement testable code, such as containerization, database integrations, and microservice architectures.
